Transfer the four ECG classification algorithms based on MIT-BIH dataset (namely TH-KNN, TS-RF, TS-SVM, TSH-LSTM) to the ECG-H dataset for model training and testing. First, use the Pan-Tompkins R-wave localization algorithm and the wavelet value to select 3R ECG samples from the homemade ECG-H dataset (due to limited manpower, only some 3R ECG samples are labeled). Then extract the optimal combination of features from the samples, input the features of the labeled 3R ECG samples into LSTM for model training and testing, and input the features of the unlabeled 3R ECG samples into the trained model for ECG type prediction.
